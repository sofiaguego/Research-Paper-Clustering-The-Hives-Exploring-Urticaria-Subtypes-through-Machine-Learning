# Research-Paper-Clustering-The-Hives-Exploring-Urticaria-Subtypes-through-Machine-Learning

This repository showcases a research project focused on advanced image analysis techniques applied to urticaria, a common dermatological condition marked by itchy hives. Leveraging cutting-edge methods such as AlexNet and Mask-R-CNN, the study explores latent patterns within urticaria images through clustering algorithms.

Preliminary findings are promising, emphasizing the need for additional labeled data for robust validation. 

The research lays the groundwork for future investigations, proposing the integration of medical chart data to enhance insights into urticaria subtypes and causes.
